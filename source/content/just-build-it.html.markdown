A foolproof way to level up your development in a short amount of time is to just build something. Pick something away from the silo of your day job or client work (something different than what you work on daily will be more exciting to work on), give yourself a deadline, and just build it.

#### Find an idea
There's no need to make this complicated or think about how to turn it into a paid product (though that can be a nice side benefit). The goal here is to find anything you can create a working prototype for in a short amount of time. API mashups are great candidates, and your twitter feed likely has inspiration if you can't think of anything.

#### Make sure the scope is small
This is key - we're going to give ourselves 2 weeks to complete this project, and do so using only our free time. Choose something you can devote a total of no more than 20 hours to.

#### You don't have to get it perfect right away
Write tests, make it look decent, and write clean code, but don't spend too much time making it perfect. The goal is just to get something completed, shipped and level up along the way.

Use something like [Heroku](http://heroku.com) so that you're not wasting time setting up a VPS. Use a front-end framework so that you don't spend as much time styling css. Where appropriate, use libraries that someone has already built so that you don't get bogged down in the details. This is not the type of project where you build authentication from scratch.

In a future post, we will likely be revisiting the app you build as a refactoring exercise.

#### Use a planning tool
We need to break or project down into small chunks so that "ok, what's next?" is a phrase that never crosses our minds. [Trello](http://trello.com) is a great free tool to do this, or you can minimal with a todo app or bulleted list. It doesn't matter what you use, just use something.

#### I'll join you!
To give you an example and to show you how this works, I'm going to be building a project that will generate before and after screenshots from comments on Github pull requests.

I'm taking this idea from a tweet from Brian Cardarella:

![Screenshot app tweet](/images/screenshot-app-tweet.png){: .no-resize}

I'm going to build this project and then do a followup post in 2 weeks detailing my approach from start to finish. 

#### Let's do this
Remember, we are going to try our best to finish our "Just build it" project in two weeks time, but don't get frustrated if you can't quite complete it. As long as you put some effort behind it, the outcome will still be the same.

If you accept the "Just build it" challenge, let me know what you're working on!
