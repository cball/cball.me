### A little background 

"Leveling up" is a term many people use to describe their learning. Born out of video games, it perfectly describes that feeling you get when you grasp a new skill. You've been following a tutorial, hacking away at little bits and pieces and you come to a point where everything just clicks. You finally understand the sum of all the parts, and you feel like you just climbed a mountain to the top of the world!

And guess what? After that mountain, any mountain of similar size or with similar features is _MUCH_ easier to climb the second time around.

This is the first post in a series

### "I'm a brand new developer" ###
First off, **congratulations**. You've chosen a career path that is constantly evolving (that's exciting!), and how far you advance is only limited by your desire to learn. If I'm able to each you one and one thing only through my blog or newsletter, it would be this: 

**Always be learning**.

### "I've been a developer or designer for many years"
If you've been in your field for any length of time, I'd be willing to bet you're not challenging yourself as much as you should. And while you may be an expert, I bet there are a lot of things you don't know. For instance:

**What has happened recently with your programming language of choice?**  
_Do you have your finger on the pulse?_

**What are your thoughts of the new kid on the block?**  
_Ember, Go, Erlang, etc_?

**When was the last time you built something just for fun?**  
_Non-work related, any language_

### Don't just stand there, do something

### Should I split this intro post into 3 posts? one focused on each?

### Remedy 1: Check out that grass on the other side

### Remedy 2: Something

### Remedy 3: Something else
