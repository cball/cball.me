### What is this blog about? ###
In order to be the best you can be in anything in life, you need to practice. My goal with this blog is to give actionable advice on *how to practice* in order to "level up" as a developer and/or a consultant.

### How I can help you: the developer ###
- I'll teach you how to stay sane when working with large codebases.
- I'll show you how to make yourself more marketable by improving your design and front-end skills. If you're a developer that "only does back-end" work, come up for air and change that viewpoint. You may not become the next best designer, but you need to be competent.
- I want to help you to avoid getting too comfortable with your skillset. The web and mobile space changes rapidly and becoming comfortable is a mind-trap that puts you in an excellent position to watch the rest of the industry pass you by.

### How I can help you: the consultant ###
Like most, I started out on nights and weekends. I learned how to price my services by trial and error, and figured out the hard way that you have to sell yourself but also learn when to say "no". 

- If your a developer interested in making the jump to consulting, I'll explain how to get there, and how to know you're ready.
- I'll explain pros and cons of subcontractors, and how they helped me grow my business.
- I'll explain quick tips to help you raise your rates and pitch ideas.

### How I can help you: better your life ###
I'm no life coach, but I want to share some things that have helped me live a happier life. The first step (learned by me the hard way of course)? **Don't work too much!**

### Why should you listen to me?
I haven't given any large talks, created a massively used open-source library, built [echobind](http://echobind.com) into a huge agency, or written a best selling book. But my guess is, more than likely, you're in the same boat.

I want to show you how these are all excellent long-term goals, but they are absolutely not requirements in order to be a successful and profitable developer or consultant. You can be a little fish in a big pond and still have a sustainable business and a happy life. Most of [echobind](http://echobind.com)'s clients love the personal attention and camaraderie they get from working with a small agency.
